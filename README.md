I've take a bit of inspiration from others to visualise my parkrun results and the associated Strava data in a Shiny dashboard.

You can find the dashboard here: https://tangandhara.shinyapps.io/ParkrunDashboard/<br><br>
And this is the link to the R script: https://github.com/tangandhara/stravaDashboard/blob/main/stravaDashboard/stravaDashboard.R
