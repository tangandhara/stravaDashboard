The parkrun activities can be filtered by distance and elevation gain. These may seem pointless filters considering parkrun is a 5km time trial but, especially for many of my earlier runs at Preston Park, parkruns were sandwiched in with a longer run and were recorded as a single activity for Strava kudos. I don't do that nowadays but thought it worth clarifying in case you thought I was getting lazy in my old age. Clicking on the markers will display an activity name, distance, and date.

The difference between the number of parkruns completed and those shown on the map below is due to approximately 40 activities in 2014-15 being recorded in RunKeeper rather than Strava and have since disappeared into the ether. A further 10 or so have not been picked up due to the filtering and cross-join of the Strava and parkrun datasets.
